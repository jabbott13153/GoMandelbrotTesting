# GoMandlebrodt

This project contains a go and a python file used to both generate and display various gifs of the mandlebrodt set respectively. This readme was made by using this helpful [webiste](https://www.makeareadme.com/)!

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install both [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) and [array2gif](https://pypi.org/project/array2gif/).

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install array2gif
```
Also ensure that you are able to run powershell scripts on your machine. To do this you may have to run "set-executionpolicy unrestricted".

## Usage

**Note**: If the name of the python file is changes from test.py, you may need to modify the shell script, and keep that in mind reading the rest of this documentation.

Running the following command in powershell will create a gif called test.gif  in your current working directory.
```bash
.\BuildGif.ps1
```
Also note that several text files with information about each frame will be created in the current working directory to pass information between go and python. These files can be quite large, and are generated by the go program, and read by the python script. This means that if you have already generated the data for the frames, and would like to just re-color the image/modify something in the python script and run it again on the same data you can just run the following and avoid re-generating the data:

```bash
py ./test.py
```

When modifying various parameters regarding what will eventually be in the final gif, make sure that when you modify the following ones, you do so carefully. If you modify them in one file that you must have them consistent across both the go and the python files. They should be relatively self explanatory, but just incase the size_of_image/frame_dimension is the number of pixels in the x and y direction of the final gif, the num_frames/number_frames is the number of frames and max_iterations is the total number of iterations allowed to check for convergence.

In the python file:
```python
#This is somewhere near the top
size_of_image = 1024
num_frames = 30
max_iterations = 1000

```
In the go file:
```go
//This is somewhere near the start of main
frame_dimension := float64(1024)
number_frames := float64(30)
max_iterations := 1000

```
**Note**: more than 100 total frames is not currently supported. It would not be difficult to change so that it does work however, but it may take a while for the program to complete.

The only parameters that you can customize exclusively in the go file are as follows. They influence the point on which you are zooming in on, and the dimensions of the starting frame. This also tangentially means that if you have a large biggest_coord_offset, then you will be starting from a very far out zoom. That means that you will need to have the gif be going for a bigger frame count in order to zoom in enough. You can also modify the zoom rate further down to change the change in image size between the images.

In the go file:
```go
//This is in the function callingAllPoints
//Change the .9 to something
x_offset := float64(zoom_factor * math.Pow(.9, i-1))


//The following is in main:
starting_coordinate := -0.7453 + 0.1127i //This is an interesting point to zoom in on
biggest_coord_offset := float64(.0013) //This is an interesting starting size too

```

The only parameters that you can exclusively modify in the python file is the frames per second of the final gif! Modify it in the following function call at the end of the file.
In the python file:
```python
write_gif(gif, 'test.gif', fps=10) #change fps as desired
```
